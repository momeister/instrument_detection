To use the Instrument Recognition program, you need to activate the desired audio file in the Python file. To do this, remove the comment sign "#" in front of the corresponding "audio_file" variable. If you want to use another audio file instead, comment out the currently active "audio_file" variable by placing a "#" in front of the variable. Then uncomment the new desired "audio_file" variable to activate it.
